// Round contract event snapshot.
//
// Generated Soroban bindings (`@sub-rosa/round-bindings`) expose the contract's
// Spec (method shapes), but contract **events** are emitted via
// `env.events().publish(...)` and never appear in the method Spec. SDK
// consumers (keeper, web, receipt-cli) and any future indexer rely on a stable
// tuple of (event_name, round_id) on the topic and a per-event data shape.
//
// This module is the canonical TS-encoded form of the event surface, used by
// snapshot tests to catch contract event drift. The updating procedure lives
// in SNAPSHOT_TESTS.md.
//
// Reference: every `symbol_short!(...)` call site in `contracts/round/src/lib.rs`.
