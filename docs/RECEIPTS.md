# Round Receipts

A **round receipt** is a portable JSON document that captures the final state of a Sub Rosa auction round. Receipts can be exported from any live contract and verified offline — no RPC, no secrets, no Stellar dependency.

## Schema

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | `number` | Receipt schema version (currently `1`) |
| `network` | `string` | Stellar network passphrase (e.g. `"Test SDF Network ; September 2015"`) |
| `networkFingerprint` | `string` (64 hex chars) | `sha256(utf8(network))` — lets the offline verifier detect a tampered `network` field without any caller context |
| `contractId` | `string` | Contract address (starts with `C`) |
| `exportedAt` | `string (ISO 8601)` | When the receipt was exported |
| `roundId` | `string` (decimal bigint) | Round number |
| `itemRef` | `string` (hex) | Item identifier (e.g. the commitment of the highest valid bid) |
| `revealRound` | `number` | Drand quicknet round used for timelock |
| `clearingRule` | `"HighestBid"` or `"LowestBid"` | Selection rule |
| `commitDeadline` | `string` (decimal) | Ledger sequence deadline for commit |
| `revealDeadline` | `string` (decimal) | Ledger sequence deadline for reveal |
| `operator` | `string` (G… address) | Round creator / prize sender |
| `auditorPubkey` | `string` (hex) | X25519 auditor public key |
| `bidders` | `string[]` | Ordered list of participant Stellar addresses |
| `bids` | `Record<string, BidReceiptEntry>` | Per-bidder entry, keyed by address |
| `winner` | `string` (G… address) or `null` | Declared winner (may be null if voided or no valid bids) |
| `winningValue` | `string` (decimal) or `null` | Declared winning bid value |
| `status` | `"Open"` / `"Revealing"` / `"Cleared"` / `"Settled"` / `"Voided"` | Round status |
| `events` | `RoundReceiptEvent[]` | The ordered on-chain event log for the round, in ledger order (see below) |

### `BidReceiptEntry`

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `commitment` | `string` (64 hex chars) | `sha256(be16(value) || nonce)` |
| `escrow` | `string` (decimal) | Escrow amount |
| `revealedValue` | `string` (decimal) or `null` | Bid value (null if not-revealed) |
| `nonce` | `string` (64 hex chars) or `null` | The per-bid 32-byte nonce. Persisted on-chain at reveal time; present in live exports for revealed bids. `null` only for unrevealed bids. |
| `hashValid` | `boolean` or `null` | Whether `revealedValue` and `nonce` match `commitment`. `null` when `nonce` is not available (unrevealed); `true`/`false` when both are present. |
| `valid` | `boolean` | Whether the bid passed all on-chain validity checks (value ≤ escrow etc.) |
| `settled` | `boolean` | Whether escrow was settled (transferred or refunded) |
| `evidence` | `object` or `null` | Contains `ciphertext` (hex, may be null after expiry) and `auditorBlob` (hex, may be null after expiry) |

Expired Temporary storage (`ciphertext`, `auditorBlob`) is marked honestly as `null`.

### `RoundReceiptEvent`

Each entry records one round-contract event, in ledger order. The event names,
their lifecycle ordering, and the topic shape are all sourced from the
generated bindings' event snapshot (`packages/round-bindings/src/event-snapshot.ts`),
so the receipt verifier and the contract cannot drift apart silently.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `string` | Event name (`symbol_short`): `created`, `commit`, `revealing`, `reveal`, `cleared`, `settled`, or `voided` |
| `topics` | `["symbol_short", "u64"]` | Topic list: topic[0] is the event name, topic[1] the u64 round id |
| `roundId` | `string` (decimal u64) | The round id carried by topic[1] — must equal the receipt's `roundId` |
| `ledger` | `number` | Ledger sequence the event was included in (ascending in a healthy log) |
| `phase` | `string` | Lifecycle phase derived from the name: `round-created`, `bid-commit`, `reveal-opened`, `bid-reveal`, `round-cleared`, `round-finalized` |

A receipt whose event log omits a required lifecycle event (for a `Settled`
round: `created`, `commit`, `revealing`, `reveal`, `cleared`, `settled`),
scrambles the ledger order, carries a topic round id different from the
receipt's `roundId`, or records more than one settle-phase event (`settled`
XOR `voided`) is rejected.

### Serialization format

Receipts use **canonical JSON** — keys are deep-sorted lexicographically. BigInt values are serialized as decimal strings (not numbers) to preserve precision. Byte strings (commitments, nonces, evidence) are lowercase hex.

## Offline verification

The `verifyReceipt` function in `@sub-rosa/sdk` performs **stateless, offline** checks:

| Check | What it detects | Error code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Schema version | Unsupported receipt format | `unsupported_version` |
| Network fingerprint | `networkFingerprint` does not match `sha256(utf8(network))` — detects a tampered passphrase without caller context | `network_mismatch` |
| Network metadata | Missing or malformed fields | `missing_network`, `invalid_contract_id`, etc. |
| Clearing rule | Invalid or missing rule | `invalid_clearing_rule` |
| **Ordered event log** | **Missing lifecycle events, scrambled ledger order, topic round-id mismatch, duplicate settles, phase/name drift** | **`missing_events`, `missing_events_required`, `event_not_in_ledger_order`, `event_round_id_mismatch`, `duplicate_settle_event`, `event_phase_mismatch`, `unknown_event_name`, `invalid_event_topics`** |
| **Expected contract id** (optional `VerifyOptions.expectedContractId`) | **Receipt exported from a different contract than the caller expects** | **`event_contract_mismatch`** |
| **Expected network** (optional `VerifyOptions.expectedNetworkPassphrase`) | **Receipt whose `network` + `networkFingerprint` were rewritten together — invisible to the fingerprint check alone** | **`event_network_mismatch`** |
| Bidder list consistency | Duplicates, missing bid entries, orphan entries | `duplicate_bidder`, `missing_bid_entry`, `orphan_bid_entry` |
| Commitment binding | For each revealed bid **where `nonce` is present**, recomputes `sha256(be16(value) || nonce)` and compares to stored commitment. Skipped when `nonce` is null (on-chain export; contract already verified on-chain). | `commitment_mismatch` |
| Winner selection | Recomputes the winner from valid revealed bids and compares to declared winner | `winner_mismatch` |
| Evidence hex format | Ciphertext/auditorBlob not valid hex | `invalid_evidence_hex` (warning) |

The ordered-event checks need **no RPC endpoint**: the event log travels inside
the receipt and is validated against the lifecycle derived from the generated
bindings. Callers that know which contract and network they expected can pin
them via `verifyReceipt(receipt, { expectedContractId, expectedNetworkPassphrase })`.

### What the verifier cannot check

- **On-chain state** — the verifier does not connect to Stellar. It cannot confirm that the receipt matches what is currently stored on-chain at `contractId`. That is a trust choice: the exporter is responsible for honesty.
- **Drand signature correctness** — the contract verifies the BLS signature. The offline verifier trusts the receipt's `revealRound` metadata.
- **Escrow amounts** — the verifier checks internal consistency but does not independently verify balances.
- **Timing** — deadlines are recorded as metadata but not cross-checked against ledger state.

### Trust model

A valid receipt proves **internal consistency**: all revealed values bind to their commitments via `sha256`, and the declared winner is the correct one given the clearing rule. This is useful for:

- **Audit trails** — prove a round was correctly computed after the fact
- **Dispute resolution** — a participant who saved the receipt can verify the operator ran the round fairly
- **Archival** — compact snapshot of a round's outcome without indexing the full chain

The receipt's trust depends on the **exporter** being honest about the on-chain data. Anyone can re-export and compare. For full trust, export immediately after settle and compare receipts from multiple parties.

## Usage

### Export from a live contract

```bash
# Requires: RPC_URL, NETWORK_PASSPHRASE, CONTRACT_ID in environment
pnpm --filter @sub-rosa/receipt-cli receipt export 1
```

### Verify offline

```bash
pnpm --filter @sub-rosa/receipt-cli receipt verify round-1-receipt.json
```

### Programmatic (TypeScript)

```ts
import { verifyReceipt, parseReceipt } from "@sub-rosa/sdk";
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";

const receipt = parseReceipt(readFileSync("round-1-receipt.json", "utf-8"));
const result = verifyReceipt(receipt);
console.log(result.valid ? "✓ Receipt valid" : "✗ Receipt invalid");
console.table(result.issues);
```

## Redaction for public demos

The SDK ships a pure `redactReceipt` helper that produces a public-safe copy of any round receipt. The original receipt is never mutated.

### Usage

```ts
import { redactReceipt, serializeReceipt, parseReceipt } from "@sub-rosa/sdk";
import { readFileSync, writeFileSync } from "node:fs";

const receipt = parseReceipt(readFileSync("round-1-receipt.json", "utf-8"));
const redacted = redactReceipt(receipt);
writeFileSync("round-1-receipt.redacted.json", serializeReceipt(redacted), "utf-8");
```

### CLI

```bash
pnpm --filter @sub-rosa/receipt-cli receipt redact round-1-receipt.json
```

This writes `round-1-receipt.redacted.json` next to the source file.

### What gets redacted

By default the following fields are replaced with `<redacted>` or indexed placeholders:

- `operator`, `winner`, `contractId`, `roundId`, `itemRef`, `revealRound`
- `bidders` array (replaced with `<redacted:0>`, `<redacted:1>`, …)
- `bids` object keys (replaced with the same `<redacted:N>` placeholders)
- `evidence.ciphertext` and `evidence.auditorBlob`
- Any other field whose name matches a sensitive key such as `memo`, `txHash`, `accountId`, etc.

**Non-sensitive proof metadata is preserved** so reviewers can still inspect the cryptographic binding inside each bid: `commitment`, `escrow`, `revealedValue`, `nonce`, `hashValid`, `valid`, `settled`, and round-level metadata such as `network`, `networkFingerprint`, `version`, `clearingRule`, and `status`.

### Keep-list

Use `keep` to preserve specific fields for review or partial verification:

```ts
const redacted = redactReceipt(receipt, {
  keep: [
    "bidders",
    "winner",
    "bids.GA4GN2X7YQKQJF5Y5X3X5X3X5X3X5X3X5X3X5X3X5X3X5X3X5X3X5X3",
  ],
});
```

- `keep: ["bidders"]` preserves the entire bidder list.
- `keep: ["bids"]` preserves the entire bids object with original keys.
- `keep: ["bids.GA4..."]` preserves a single bid entry and its nested evidence.
- `keep: ["bids.GA4... .commitment"]` preserves just the commitment field.

### Determinism

`redactReceipt` is fully deterministic: calling it repeatedly on the same receipt yields identical serialised output. This makes it safe to use in automated demo pipelines and snapshot tests.

## Fixtures

Test fixtures live in `services/receipt-cli/src/fixtures/`:

| Fixture | Expectation |
| --- | --- |
| `golden.json` | 3 bidders, HighestBid, bidder 2 wins with 250, full ordered event log — passes all checks |
| `testnet-proof.json` | 2 bidders, round 42, full ordered event log — passes all checks (represents a real testnet export) |
| `tampered-winner.json` | Declared winner differs from computed winner — `winner_mismatch` |
| `tampered-values.json` | Revealed values swapped so commitments don't bind — `commitment_mismatch` |
| `tampered-commitment.json` | One commitment hash replaced with garbage — `commitment_mismatch` |
| `tampered-network.json` | Passphrase changed to mainnet but `networkFingerprint` kept as testnet — always fails with `network_mismatch` |
| `tampered-order.json` | Tied bids, bidders reordered so winner changes — `winner_mismatch` |
| `tampered-evidence.json` | Invalid hex in evidence ciphertext — `invalid_evidence_hex` |
| `tampered-events.json` | Golden receipt with the `settled` event stripped from the event log — `missing_events_required` |

Run fixture tests:

```bash
pnpm --filter @sub-rosa/receipt-cli test
```
